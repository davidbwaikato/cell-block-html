To compile up Redis from source, do the following:


    tar xvzf redis-6.2.6.tar.gz
    cd redis-6.2.6
    make
    cd ..

This creates executables in the 'src' directory.

In the home directory to Cell-Block-HTML there is:


  ./RUN-REDIS-SERVER.sh


which runs the executable in the 'src' directory.
