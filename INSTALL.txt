# Get your envirnment setup for Cell-Block-HTML
# In addition to commonly installed Unix command-line tools, you will need:
#  -- NodeJS/npm
#  -- realpath 

  source ./SETUP.bash 

# Now check out the cell-block-html (cbhtml) customized ethercalc
  spreadsheet server:

  git clone https://github.com/davidbwaikato/cbh-ethercalc.git cbhtml-ethercalc

# And build:

  cd cbhtml-ethercalc
  npm i

# Next, within ethercalc install the customized socialcalc component:

  cd node_modules
  /bin/mv socialcalc socialcalc.orig

  git clone https://github.com/davidbwaikato/cbh-socialcalc.git socialcalc
  cd socialcalc
  npm install
  npm run build

# Return to the top-level cbhtml-ethercalc level:
  cd ../..

# And generate the webpack files and start the server:

  make

# Or to run within a website that needs a URL prefix, launch in the form:

  make ETHERCALC_ARGS="--basepath /cell-block-html"

# This ultimately runnings:
#  node app.js --cors --basepath /cell-block-html
#  Please connect to: http://atea-test02:8000/
# ...
#

# The server tries to use Redis as the backing store, but given the
# minimal setup this INSTALL.txt file describes, no Redis backing store
# server is running, leading to:
#  Error: Redis connection to localhost:6379 failed - connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379
#
# It then falls back to using local file system storage
