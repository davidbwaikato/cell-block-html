# Get your envirnment setup for Cell-Block-HTML
# In addition to commonly installed Unix command-line tools, you will need:
#  -- NodeJS/npm
#  -- realpath 

  source ./SETUP.bash 

# First install the customized socialcalc component:

  git clone https://github.com/davidbwaikato/cbh-socialcalc.git socialcalc
  cd socialcalc
  npm install
  npm run build

# The last line generates a lot of warnings and errors (!!) related to Javascript
# as best as I have been able to establish these messages are in fact benign,
# and the files it generates work just fine with the parent project (ethtercalc)

# Return to the root cell-block-html folder:

  cd ..

# Now check out the cell-block-html (cbhtml) customized ethercalc
  spreadsheet server:

  git clone https://github.com/davidbwaikato/cbh-ethercalc.git cbhtml-ethercalc

# And build:

  cd cbhtml-ethercalc
  npm i

# And generate the webpack files and start the server:

  make

# Or to run within a website that needs a URL prefix, launch in the form:

  make ETHERCALC_ARGS="--basepath /cell-block-html"

# This ultimately runs:
#  node app.js --cors --basepath /cell-block-html
#  Please connect to: http://<hostname>:8000/
# ...
#

# The server tries to use Redis as the backing store, but given the
# minimal setup this INSTALL.txt file describes, no Redis backing store
# server is running, leading to:
#  Error: Redis connection to localhost:6379 failed - connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379
#
# It then falls back to using local file system storage


# Example use of the OCCURS() function to count how many times a substring/regular expression
# occurs in a text cell:

# In Cell B4 enter:

  Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing) but herself for her election loss. She lost the debates and lost her direction! Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isnâ€™t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems.
  
# Now in Cell B5 enter:

=occurs("/crooked hillary/gi",G5)

# Result => 2
